# humidity_sensor

This project includes code to operate a wireless humidity and temperature sensor for the purpose
of mold detection for condition monitoring in the housing sector.

1) Arduino Code

The transceiver is a nRF2410 wireless unit that is controlled by an Arduino, the code for 
receiving and transmitting serial data is included in this repository.

2) Python Software

The temperature and humidity data is then processed by a program that gives an evaluation on 
when mold will form.
